** Roadmap
*** TODO Add comparison operators to the language
*** TODO Add string interpolation
Maybe use {} interpolation syntax, e.g., "Welcome to {$location.city}!"
*** TODO Write a typechecker
We need to have an entry in the type context for all the fields of the context
macros in the program. Such entries are just trees with the types at the
leaves.
